### What are The Federalist Papers?
The Federalist Papers are a collection of 85 essays written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay under the pseudonym 'Publius' in 1787-88. The aim of these articles was to persuade New Yorkers to support ratification of the US Constitution.

Examples of ideas in The Federalist Papers include opposition to the Bill of Rights (Federalist No. 84) over dangers of limiting the rights that people had to those only appearing in the bill, giving the govenment power to infringe on rights not listed, as well as topics on foerign influence, interstate conflict, power and taxation and most extensively the US Constitution and Power of Congress and structure of the new federal government.
